# StochOpt_Code

This is the code used in the generation and postprocessing of the data published in the dissertation "Stochastic Optimization with High-Dimensional Uncertainties" <doi here. 
It includes the code fo reach numerical simulation presented by section and subsegmented into each example. Each folder contains an additional readme file to explain how it works. 

Additionally, data generated in the dissertation is available on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18714508 . The data files are structured in the same folder structure as the code. The readme file explaining the data structure which is generated by the code is also included in this repository for clarity about what is generated and stored. 

The repository includes the conda enviroment with which it was run. Install it with "conda env create -f 2dspring.yml". (The name is an unfortunate leftover).
